            <p>
                The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle,<br>
                 encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land <br>
                  It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore.<br>
                   A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size.<br>
                    Although it is the sister species of the brown bear,it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche<br>
                    , with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water,<br>
                     and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.[9] Although most polar bears are born on land,<br>
                      they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means "maritime bear" and derives from this fact. <br>
                      Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present.<br>
                       Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals.[10]<br>
            </p>
            
            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <p>
                The polar bear is a marine mammal because it spends many months of the year at sea. <br>
                [46] However, it is the only living marine mammal with powerful,<br> 
                large limbs and feet that allow them to cover kilometres on foot and run on land.<br> 
                Its preferred habitat is the annual sea ice covering the waters over the continental shelf <br> 
                and the Arctic inter-island archipelagos. These areas, known as the "Arctic ring of life",<br> 
                have high biological productivity in comparison to the deep waters of the high Arctic.<br> 
                The polar bear tends to frequent areas where sea ice meets water, <br> 
                such as polynyas and leads (temporary stretches of open water in Arctic ice),<br> 
                to hunt the seals that make up most of its diet.Freshwater is limited in these environments<br>
                 because it is either locked up in snow or saline.<br>
                  Polar bears are able to produce water through the metabolism of fats found in seal blubber,<br>
                  and are therefore found primarily along the perimeter of the polar ice pack,<br> 
                  rather than in the Polar Basin close to the North Pole where the density of seals is low.[51]

            <h2>Physical characteristics</h2>
            <p>
                The only other bear similar in size to the polar bear is the Kodiak bear,<br>
                 which is a subspecies of brown bear.[52] Adult male polar bears weigh 350–700 kg (770–1,500 lb) <br>
                 and measure 2.4–3 metres (7 ft 10 in–9 ft 10 in) in total length.[53] Around the Beaufort Sea, however,<br>
                  mature males reportedly average 450 kg (1,000 lb).[54] Adult females are roughly half the size of males<br>
                   and normally weigh 150–250 kg (330–550 lb), measuring 1.8–2.4 metres (5 ft 11 in–7 ft 10 in) in length.<br>
                    Elsewhere, a slightly larger estimated average weight of 260 kg (570 lb) was claimed for adult females.<br>
                     When pregnant, however, females can weigh as much as 500 kg (1,100 lb).<br> 
                     The polar bear is among the most sexually dimorphic of mammals, surpassed only by the pinnipeds such as elephant seals.[56]<br>
                      The largest polar bear on record, reportedly weighing 1,002 kg (2,209 lb), was a male shot <br>
                      at Kotzebue Sound in northwestern Alaska in 1960. This specimen, when mounted, stood 3.39 m (11 ft 1 in) tall on its hindlegs.<br>
                       The shoulder height of an adult polar bear is 122 to 160 cm (4 ft 0 in to 5 ft 3 in).[57][58] While all bears are short-tailed,<br>
                        the polar bear's tail is relatively the shortest amongst living bears, ranging from 7 to 13 cm (2.8 to 5.1 in) in length.[59]
